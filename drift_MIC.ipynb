    "### This function will update the resistance level of a WT protein into all other states by using \n",

    "### to make this procedure more clear: If X_WT=2 ug/ml and we apply a simple DME of three scales c(1,0.5,2),\n",
    "### the new resistance levels are: 2*1=2, 2*0.5=1, and 2*2=4 ug/ml.\n",
